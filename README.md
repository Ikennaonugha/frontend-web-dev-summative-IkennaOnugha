‚ú® Features

This application is built using vanilla HTML, CSS (Flexbox and custom styling), and JavaScript (ES Modules), with a strong focus on responsiveness and accessibility.

Data & Persistence

Data Model: Each record includes a unique id, title, dueDate (YYYY-MM-DD), duration (in minutes), tag, createdAt, and updatedAt.

Auto-Save: All state changes are automatically persisted to localStorage.

Import/Export: Data can be imported and exported as a JSON file, with mandatory structure validation upon import.

User Interface & Layout

Sections: Includes dedicated views for About, Dashboard/Stats, Records Table, Add/Edit Form, and Settings.

Responsiveness: Mobile-first design utilizing Flexbox and three media query breakpoints (360px, 768px, 1024px) to ensure optimal viewing on all devices.

Aesthetics: Features at least one tasteful CSS transition/animation (e.g., slide-in panel for forms) for improved UX.

Record Management

Forms & Validation: A dedicated form is used to add and edit records, featuring real-time regex validation.

Table View: All records are displayed in a responsive table (swapping to cards on smaller screens).

Sorting: Records can be sorted dynamically by dueDate, title (A-Z), and duration (asc/desc).

Edit & Delete: Records can be edited inline within the table or deleted with a confirmation prompt.

Stats & Targets

Dashboard Metrics: Displays total number of records, the sum of all tracked duration (in hours and minutes), the top-performing tag, and a simple last-7-days trend chart.

Study Target: Users can set a weekly duration target (in minutes) in the Settings panel. The Dashboard provides an ARIA live update on the remaining time or overage.

Powerful Regex Search

A live search input allows users to filter the table using custom regular expressions.

Includes a case-insensitive toggle.

Search matches are highlighted within the table view using the <mark> tag without disrupting the content flow or accessibility.

üîç Regex Catalog

All form inputs and the live search functionality are powered by Regular Expressions for data integrity and flexible querying.

Field / Feature

Pattern

Purpose & Example

Title/Description (Form Validation)

^\S(?:.*\S)?$

Mandatory: Prevents records with only spaces, and disallows leading or trailing whitespace. e.g., " Final Exam Study " fails, "Final Exam Study" passes.

Duration (Form Validation)

`^(0

[1-9]\d*)(.\d{1,2})?$`

Due Date (Form Validation)

`^\d{4}-(0[1-9]

1[0-2])-(0[1-9]

Tag (Form Validation)

^[A-Za-z]+(?:[ -][A-Za-z]+)*$

Category: Allows letters, single hyphens, and single spaces between words. e.g., CS-301, Group Meeting.

Advanced Search (Live Search)

\b(\w+)\s+\1\b

Back-Reference: Used to detect and highlight instances of accidental duplicate words in the record title or description. e.g., "Review notes the the night before."

Search Filter (Live Search)

^@tag:\w+

Finds records where the description begins with a specific tag prefix. e.g., searching for @tag:urgent only returns high-priority items.

‚ôø Accessibility (A11y) & UX Notes

The application adheres to accessibility best practices to ensure all users can interact effectively:

Semantic Structure: Uses HTML5 landmark elements (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <section>, <footer>) to provide clear structure for screen readers.

Keyboard Navigation: All interactive elements (buttons, links, inputs, sort headers) are focusable and operable via keyboard.

Focus Visibility: Custom, highly visible focus rings are provided for all interactive elements to aid keyboard users.

Live Regions: The dashboard utilizes an element with role="status" and aria-live="polite" to non-intrusively announce updates to the study target status (remaining time or overage).

Skip Link: A "Skip to Content" link is available at the top of the page for users navigating with a keyboard or screen reader.

Color Contrast: All text and interactive elements meet WCAG AA standards for contrast.
